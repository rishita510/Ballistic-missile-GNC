# ðŸš€ Ballistic Missile GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control)
This repository contains documentation, models,and simulation code for the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) of a ballistic missile. It includes 3-DOF dynamics.

## Contents
- [Documentation](docs/)
- [Source Code](src/)
- [Results](results/)
- [Notebooks](notebooks/)

This repository aims to:

- Model the **missile dynamics** (3-DOF and 6-DOF)
- Implement **guidance laws** (e.g., Proportional Navigation)
- Simulate **navigation systems** (INS, GPS)
- Design **control laws** (PID / LQR)
- Combine all into a **full GNC simulation**
- Document the **mathematical background** and **simulation results**
